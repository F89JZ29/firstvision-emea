Self Servicing
==============

In this section of the API guide, you will find use cases related to the self-servicing of a customer. This is most commonly used within online banking tools but will also be used by customer service agents to perform the same tasks.

There are 3 categories in this section:

- Customer
- Account
- Card

For definitions and further information around each of these, please refer to the [Overview of FirstVision terminology](./?path=docs/getting-started/OverviewOfFirstVisionTerminology.md).
